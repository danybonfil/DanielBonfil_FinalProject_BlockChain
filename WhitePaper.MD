# VoteChain Whitepaper
# Voting dApp - Smart Contract on Ethereum - FinalProject_BlockChain
## Introduction:

The motivation for proposing this decentralized application (dApp) raises from the new system of referendums that the Mexican Government implemented, which can be improved by including a hybrid of blockchain digital and physical voting. The past July of 2018, Mexico had general elections for president, and has underwent three referendums that have had immediate impact in the future of the Mexican people and the countries' economy.

# Applaude government innovation, enhance it with technology:
Incorporating new policies is never easy. However, doing it with lax procedures could result counterintuitive rather than innovative.

For a democratic tool to be succesful, the following should be considered:
- Prevent the use of this tool for the antagonization of different interest groups
- Enhance rather than deteriorating a social involvement 
- Strengthen public confidence in public administration

# Background:
- It has been hypothesized that *direct democratic institutions* make politicians more accountable â€“and that this would lead to policy choices that are closer to the preferences of the citizens. 
- In real-world societies beyond a certain size, *representative and direct democracy are not an alternative*. 
- Rather, a different degree of direct democratic institutions is combined with representative institutions, as no sizeable society can decide on all issues directly. (Brousseau E., 2008)

# Case Studies:
- USA
- Brazil
- Estonia
